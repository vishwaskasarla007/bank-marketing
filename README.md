BANK MARKETING ANALYSIS

Domain Description

Today organizations, which hire data scientists are especially interested in job candidate’s
portfolio. Analysis of organization’s marketing data is one of the most typical applications of data
science and machine learning. Such analysis will definetely be a nice contribution to the protfolio.

About DataSet :

In general, datasets which contain marketing data can be used for 2 different business goals:

Prediction of the results of the marketing campaign for each customer and clarification of factors which
affect the campaign results. This helps to find out the ways how to make marketing campaigns more
efficient.
Finding out customer segments, using data for customers, who subscribed to term deposit. This helps to
identify the profile of a customer, who is more likely to acquire the product and develop more targeted
marketing campaigns.

This dataset contains banking marketing campaign data and we can use it to optimize marketing
campaigns to attract more customers to term deposit subscription

Why I choose this Dataset :

As I was interested in banking sector so I have choosen this data set by analysing this I can gain some
knowledge which will help me in future
Conclusion :
Key outcomes of the analysis are the recommendations for future bank marketing campaigns:

The customer’s account balance has a huge influence on the campaign’s outcome. People with account
balance above 1490$ are more likely to subscribe for term deposit, so future address those customers.
The customer's age affects campaign outcome as well. Future campains should concentrate on
customers from age categories below 30 years old and above 50 years old.
Number of contacts with the customer during the campaign is also very important. The number of
contacts with the customer shouldn’t exceed 4.
